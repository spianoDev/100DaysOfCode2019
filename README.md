# 100DaysOfCode2019

## A place where I show algorithmic problems and solutions in JavaScript and Python.

Please note the code will be organized by days and will include many comments to demonstrate my thinking as I work through the problem. This is much like a whiteboarding challenge and all answers are verified on [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard). Please visit the link to see more challenges.
